He knows her well enough to know she has specific tastes. Instead of going through the normal routines of buying things that Danae would return, he decided to try something different.</p><p>Christmas is about showing loved one's some love. And while cash is the easiest thing, it can also come across as the least caring.</p><p>So Dave thought about what he would buy if he knew what Danae liked and drew up 4 cards and wrapped those with cash.</p><p>The positive result was so strong that Dave wondered if other people might benefit of this hybrid approach.</p><h2>About</h2><p>A gift card is more than a transaction. It's a way to show someone you are thinking of them. It's also a way of saying, I know you well enough to know our tastes are different.</p><p>The one downside of a gift card is it's presentation. You go to the trouble to buy one but the thought and emotion don't really show through.</p><p>The upside of a present is the experience of opening up something that's unknown and upon unwrapping you then stare at something shiny and new.</p><p>A feather is both a wrapped present of a limited edition art and a giftcard. It shows that you are thinking of someone but want them to have something they love.</p><p>My wife likes fun things for Christmas. Jewelry, Clothes, essential oils, and some lingere.</p><p>Though I asked her what she wanted for christmas, I wouldn't have gotten her something she really wanted.</p></div><div class="buy"></div></div></body><script type="text/javascript">(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
